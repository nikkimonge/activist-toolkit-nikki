        <h2>Nikki Monge</h2>
        <p id="me">
          My name is Nikki Monge and I am a senior in high school. Since I
          started attending an all-girls high school, I have become invested in
          learning about and fighting for womenâ€™s rights. I've heard countless
          times growing up about how "men are better than women." I've heard of
          stories of women in the workforce being sexually abused. I've seen
          countless friends and family members struggle with being sexually
          abused and being afraid to speak up. I see the violation of women's
          rights with my very own eyes every day, as I'm sure many of you do,
          too. My goal, with your help, is to do whatever we can to help fight
          for women's rights and gives us the freedom we rightfully deserve.
        </p>
